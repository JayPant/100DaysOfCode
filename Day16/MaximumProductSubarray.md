# Intuition
The problem asks for the maximum product of any subarray of the given array. One way to approach this is to consider all subarrays and find the maximum product. However, a more efficient approach is to use a dynamic programming technique to keep track of the maximum and minimum product ending at each index. This allows us to avoid recalculating subarray products.

# Approach
Initialize max and min variables to track the maximum and minimum product ending at the current index. Initialize result to store the final maximum product.
Iterate through the array and update max and min based on the current element. If the current element is negative, swap max and min since multiplying by a negative number can change the sign and result in a larger product.
Update result with the maximum of result and max.
Return result as the maximum product of any subarray.


# Complexity

Time complexity: (O(n)), where (n) is the number of elements in the array. We iterate through the array once.
Space complexity: (O(1)). We use a constant amount of extra space.


# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
       int n = nums.length;

       double max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
       double pre=1,post=1;

       for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
            if(pre == 0) pre =1;
            if(post==0) post =1;

            pre *= nums[i];
            post *= nums[n-i-1];
            max = Math.max(max, Math.max(pre,post));
       }

       return (int)max;
    
    }
}```
