## Intuition
To solve the problem of level order traversal in a binary tree, we can visualize the tree as a series of levels, where each level contains nodes at the same depth. The goal is to traverse the tree level by level, from top to bottom, and from left to right within each level. This is a typical problem that can be efficiently solved using a queue data structure to keep track of nodes at each level.

## Approach
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Create a `List<List<Integer>>` to store the result for each level.
   - Use a queue to perform a breadth-first traversal. Initialize it with the root node.
   - Add a sentinel value (`null`) to mark the end of each level.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - While the queue is not empty, process each node level by level.
   - For each node, check if it is `null`. If it is `null`, it means we have finished processing the current level:
     - Add the current level list to the result list.
     - If the queue is not empty, add another `null` to mark the end of the next level.
     - Initialize a new list for the next level.
   - If the node is not `null`, add its value to the current level list.
   - Add the left and right children of the node to the queue if they are not `null`.

3. **Completion**:
   - The process ends when all levels are processed, and the queue becomes empty.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - Each node in the tree is processed exactly once, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - The space complexity is mainly due to the queue, which at most can hold nodes from two levels of the tree. In the worst case, this could be approximately \(O(n)\).

## Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

    public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new LinkedList<>();
        if (root == null) return ans;

        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(root);
        q.add(null); // Sentinel to mark end of level

        List<Integer> level = new ArrayList<>();

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode currNode = q.remove();
            if (currNode == null) {
                ans.add(level); // End of a level
                if (q.isEmpty()) {
                    break;
                } else {
                    q.add(null); // Mark end of next level
                    level = new ArrayList<>();
                }
            } else {
                level.add(currNode.val);
                if (currNode.left != null) {
                    q.add(currNode.left);
                }
                if (currNode.right != null) {
                    q.add(currNode.right);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
