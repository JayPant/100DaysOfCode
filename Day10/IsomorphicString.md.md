# Intuition
To determine if two strings are isomorphic, the characters in the first string can be replaced to get the second string, while preserving the order of characters. Each character in the first string must map to exactly one character in the second string and vice versa.

# Approach
Length Check:

If the lengths of the two strings are not equal, return false since they cannot be isomorphic.
Mapping Characters:

Use two arrays to keep track of the mapping positions of characters from both strings. The arrays will store the last seen positions of characters.
Iterate through the characters of both strings:
If the last seen positions of the current characters in both strings are not the same, return false.
Update the last seen positions for the current characters in both strings.
Final Check:

If the iteration completes without mismatches, return true since the strings are isomorphic.

# Complexity
Time complexity: (O(n))
We iterate through the strings once, where (n) is the length of the strings.
Space complexity: (O(1))
We use a constant amount of extra space for the arrays (200 elements each), regardless of the input size.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        int[] indexS = new int[200]; 
        int[] indexT = new int[200]; 

        if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (indexS[s.charAt(i)] != indexT[t.charAt(i)]) {
                return false; 
            }
            indexS[s.charAt(i)] = i + 1; 
            indexT[t.charAt(i)] = i + 1; 
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
