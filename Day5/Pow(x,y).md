# Intuition
When faced with the problem of computing (x) raised to the power (n) ((x^n)), my first thought was to use a divide-and-conquer approach. The idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, leveraging the properties of exponents for efficient computation.

# Approach
To solve this problem, I used a recursive approach with the following steps:

* Base Case: Any number to the power of 0 is 1.
* Handling Negative Powers: If (n) is negative, compute the reciprocal of (x) and use the positive equivalent of (n). Special handling is required for Integer.MIN_VALUE to avoid overflow.
* Recursive Case: Recursively calculate the result of (x) raised to (n/2).
* Combine Results: If (n) is even, the result is the square of the recursive result. If (n) is odd, multiply an additional (x) to account for the remaining power.
This approach ensures efficient computation by reducing the number of multiplications needed, achieving logarithmic complexity.

# Complexity
Time complexity: O(log⁡n), as we are dividing the problem size by 2 in each recursive step.
Space complexity: O(log⁡n), due to the recursion stack.
Code

```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1; // base case: any number to the power of 0 is 1

        if (n < 0) {
            x = 1 / x;
            // To handle the case when n is Integer.MIN_VALUE
            if (n == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {
                n = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // To avoid overflow
                return x * myPow(x, n);
            }
            n = -n;
        }

        double smallPow = myPow(x, n / 2); // Recursive call

        if (n % 2 == 0) return smallPow * smallPow; // when n is even

        return smallPow * smallPow * x; // when n is odd
    }
}
```
