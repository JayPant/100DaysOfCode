# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge repository! This repository documents my daily progress, solutions, and learnings as I embark on a coding journey to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Overview

In this challenge, I commit to solving coding problems from various platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, and more. Each day, I'll be sharing my approach, code solutions, and any insights gained from the problems I tackle.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into daily folders, each containing:

- A `solution.md` file describing the problem statement, constraints, intuition, approach and solution all things in one place.


## Daily Updates

- **Day 1:** [Questions](Link to solution) - 
- **Day 2:** [Questions](Link to solution) - 
- **Day 3:** [Questions](Link to solution) - 
- ...

Feel free to explore the daily folders to see my progress and follow along with my coding journey. I'm excited to learn, grow, and share this experience with you all!
