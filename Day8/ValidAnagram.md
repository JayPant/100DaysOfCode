# Intuition
To determine if two strings, s and t, are anagrams, we need to check if both strings contain the same characters with the same frequencies. A straightforward way to achieve this is by using a frequency counter for each character in both strings.

# Approach
Initialize a frequency counter: Use an array of size 123 (to cover all ASCII characters up to 'z') to keep track of character counts.
Count characters in s: Iterate over the characters in s and increment the corresponding index in the array.
Count characters in t: Iterate over the characters in t and decrement the corresponding index in the array.
Check the frequency counter: After processing both strings, if any value in the frequency counter is not zero, return false. Otherwise, return true.

# Complexity
Time complexity:

Iterating through each character in both strings takes (O(n + m)) time, where (n) is the length of s and (m) is the length of t.
Thus, the overall time complexity is (O(n + m)).
Space complexity:

The frequency counter array uses a fixed amount of space ((O(1))), as it has a constant size of 123 regardless of the input size.
Thus, the space complexity is (O(1)).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        int[] count = new int[123];
        
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) 
            count[ch]++;
        
        for (char ch : t.toCharArray()) 
            count[ch]--;
        
        for (int i : count) {
            if (i != 0) return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
