# Intuition
The problem requires us to check if an array can be divided into pairs of equal values. If we can pair up every element in the array, then each element must appear an even number of times.

# Approach
Initialize a frequency counter: Use an array of size 501 (to cover the possible range of values in nums from 0 to 500) to keep track of the count of each number in the array.
Count occurrences: Iterate through the input array nums and increment the corresponding index in the frequency counter array for each number.
Check the counts: Iterate through the frequency counter array and check if every count is even. If any count is odd, return false because it means we cannot pair all elements. If all counts are even, return true.


# Complexity
Time complexity:

Counting the occurrences takes O(n) time, where (n) is the length of the input array nums.
Checking the frequency counts takes O(k) time, where (k) is the size of the frequency counter array (501 in this case, which is constant).
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).
Space complexity:

The frequency counter array uses a fixed amount of space O(1), as it has a constant size of 501 regardless of the input size.
Thus, the space complexity is O(1).

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean divideArray(int[] nums) {
        // Initialize an array to count occurrences of each number
        int[] count = new int[501];

        // Count occurrences of each number in nums
        for (int num : nums) {
            count[num]++;
        }

        // Check if each count is even
        for (int i = 0; i < 501; i++) {
            if (count[i] % 2 != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // If all counts are even, return true
        return true;
    }
}
