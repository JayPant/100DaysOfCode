# Intuition
To determine if a given string can be a palindrome after deleting at most one character, my initial thought is to use a two-pointer approach. By comparing characters from both ends of the string towards the center, we can check for mismatches. When a mismatch is found, we can either skip the character on the left or the character on the right and check if either resulting string is a palindrome.

# Approach
1. Use two pointers, `left` starting from the beginning of the string and `right` starting from the end.
2. Traverse the string with the two pointers. If characters at `left` and `right` are equal, move both pointers inward.
3. If a mismatch is found, use a helper function `isPalindrome` to check:
   - If the substring formed by skipping the character at `left` is a palindrome.
   - If the substring formed by skipping the character at `right` is a palindrome.
4. If either substring is a palindrome, return `true`. If neither is a palindrome, return `false`.
5. If no mismatches are found during the traversal, the string is already a palindrome, so return `true`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the length of the string. Each character is checked at most twice.
- **Space complexity**: $$O(1)$$, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    // Helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s, int left, int right) {
        while (left < right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public boolean validPalindrome(String s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) {
                // Check by skipping either the left character or the right character
                return isPalindrome(s, left + 1, right) || isPalindrome(s, left, right - 1);
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }

        return true; // The string is already a palindrome
    }
}
```
