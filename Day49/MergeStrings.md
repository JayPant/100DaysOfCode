# Intuition
When given two strings and asked to merge them alternately, the first thought is to interleave characters from both strings one by one. This ensures that characters from both strings are placed in the final string alternately until one of the strings is exhausted.

# Approach
1. Initialize a `StringBuilder` to build the final merged string.
2. Use two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate over `word1` and `word2` respectively.
3. In a loop, alternately append characters from `word1` and `word2` to the `StringBuilder` until the end of one of the strings is reached.
4. If there are remaining characters in `word1`, append them to the `StringBuilder`.
5. If there are remaining characters in `word2`, append them to the `StringBuilder`.
6. Convert the `StringBuilder` to a string and return it.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the total length of the combined strings. This is because each character from both strings is processed exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the length of the final merged string. This is due to the space required to store the merged result in the `StringBuilder`.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        // Merge characters alternately from both strings
        while (i < word1.length() && j < word2.length()) {
            str.append(word1.charAt(i++));
            str.append(word2.charAt(j++));
        }

        // Append the remaining characters of word1, if any
        while (i < word1.length()) {
            str.append(word1.charAt(i++));
        }

        // Append the remaining characters of word2, if any
        while (j < word2.length()) {
            str.append(word2.charAt(j++));
        }

        return str.toString();
    }
}
```
