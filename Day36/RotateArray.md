## Intuition
The task is to rotate an array to the right by `k` steps. The first thought might be to shift each element one by one, but that would be inefficient for large arrays. A more efficient approach involves reversing parts of the array to achieve the rotation in place.

## Approach
1. **Reverse the First Part**: Reverse the first `n-k` elements of the array.
2. **Reverse the Second Part**: Reverse the last `k` elements of the array.
3. **Reverse the Entire Array**: Finally, reverse the entire array.

This approach effectively rotates the array by `k` steps to the right.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array, because reversing a part of the array is an \(O(n)\) operation.
- **Space Complexity**: The algorithm uses \(O(1)\) additional space, as it only uses a few extra variables for swapping elements.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    static void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        arr[i] = arr[i] + arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[i] - arr[j];
        arr[i] = arr[i] - arr[j];
    }

    static void reverse(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int left = i, right = j;
        while (left < right) {
            swap(arr, left, right);
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }

    public void rotate(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        k = k % n;  // Ensure k is within the bounds of the array length
        reverse(arr, 0, n - k - 1);
        reverse(arr, n - k, n - 1);
        reverse(arr, 0, n - 1);
    }
}
```
