# Intuition
To solve the problem of finding the smallest divisor such that the sum of the division results does not exceed a given threshold, we need to consider how different divisors affect the sum. Since smaller divisors will produce larger sums and larger divisors will produce smaller sums, we can use a binary search approach to efficiently find the smallest valid divisor.

# Approach
1. **Binary Search Initialization**: 
   - Set the lower bound (`low`) to 1 (the smallest possible divisor).
   - Set the upper bound (`high`) to the maximum number in the array (`maxNum` function).

2. **Binary Search Process**:
   - Calculate the midpoint (`mid`) between `low` and `high`.
   - Check if `mid` is a valid divisor using the `isDivisor` function:
     - Iterate through the array, dividing each element by `mid` and summing the results, using `(i + mid - 1) / mid` to handle ceiling division.
     - If the total sum is less than or equal to the threshold, `mid` is a valid divisor.
   - Adjust the search range based on whether `mid` is valid:
     - If valid, record `mid` as a potential answer and search the lower half (`high = mid - 1`).
     - If not valid, search the upper half (`low = mid + 1`).

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Once the binary search completes, the smallest valid divisor is stored in `ans`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The binary search runs in $$O(\log(\text{maxNum}))$$ where `maxNum` is the largest element in the array.
  - For each binary search step, we iterate through the array, which takes $$O(n)$$ time.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is $$O(n \log(\text{maxNum}))$$.

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ as we only use a few extra variables regardless of the input size.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    
    private boolean isDivisor(int[] arr, int num, int threshold) {
        int divSum = 0;
        for (int i : arr) {
            divSum += (i + num - 1) / num; 
        }
        return divSum <= threshold;
    }

    public int smallestDivisor(int[] nums, int threshold) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = maxNum(nums);
        int ans = 0;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (isDivisor(nums, mid, threshold)) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1; 
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    private int maxNum(int[] arr) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i : arr) {
            if (max < i) max = i;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
