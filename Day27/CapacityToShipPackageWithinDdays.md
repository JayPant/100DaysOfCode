# Intuition
To determine the minimum ship capacity needed to ship all packages within a given number of days, we need to consider the weights of the packages and the order in which they are shipped. Using a binary search approach helps to efficiently find the smallest capacity that can achieve the goal.

# Approach
1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - Set the lower bound (`low`) to the maximum weight in the `weights` array, as the ship must at least be able to carry the heaviest package.
   - Set the upper bound (`high`) to the sum of all weights, representing the capacity needed if all packages are shipped in one day.

2. **Binary Search Process**:
   - Calculate the midpoint (`mid`) between `low` and `high`.
   - Use a helper function `canShipInDays` to check if it is possible to ship all packages within the given number of days with a ship capacity of `mid`:
     - Iterate through the `weights` array, keeping track of the total weight for the current day.
     - If adding the current package exceeds `mid`, start a new day and reset the total weight.
     - If the number of days exceeds the allowed days, return false.
   - Adjust the search range based on whether the current `mid` value can ship all packages in the given days:
     - If `mid` is valid, record it as a potential answer and search the lower half (`high = mid - 1`).
     - If not valid, search the upper half (`low = mid + 1`).

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Once the binary search completes, the smallest valid capacity is stored in `ans`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - The binary search runs in $$O(\log(\text{sum(weights)} - \text{max(weights)}))$$.
  - For each binary search step, we iterate through the `weights` array, which takes $$O(n)$$ time.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is $$O(n \log(\text{sum(weights)} - \text{max(weights)}))$$.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ as we only use a few extra variables regardless of the input size.

# Code
```java
class Solution {

    private boolean canShipInDays(int[] weights, int days, int capacity) {
        int dayCount = 1;
        int currentWeight = 0;

        for (int weight : weights) {
            if (currentWeight + weight > capacity) {
                dayCount++;
                currentWeight = 0;
            }
            currentWeight += weight;
        }

        return dayCount <= days;
    }

    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int days) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = 0;

        for (int weight : weights) {
            low = Math.max(low, weight);
            high += weight;
        }

        int ans = high;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (canShipInDays(weights, days, mid)) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
