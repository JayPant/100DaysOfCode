# Intuition
The problem requires implementing a stack using two queues. A stack follows Last In First Out (LIFO) order, whereas a queue follows First In First Out (FIFO) order. By using two queues, we can reverse the order of elements to achieve the desired stack behavior.

# Approach
1. Use two queues, `q1` and `q2`. Queue `q1` will be used for storing elements in the correct order for stack operations, and queue `q2` will be used as a temporary queue during the `push` operation.
2. **Push operation**: To maintain the LIFO order in `q1`, we need to:
   - Move all elements from `q1` to `q2`.
   - Add the new element to `q1`.
   - Move all elements back from `q2` to `q1`.
3. **Pop operation**: Simply remove the front element from `q1`.
4. **Top operation**: Return the front element from `q1` without removing it.
5. **Empty operation**: Check if `q1` is empty.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**:
  - `push`: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the stack, due to moving elements between the two queues.
  - `pop`: $$O(1)$$, as it involves a single remove operation on `q1`.
  - `top`: $$O(1)$$, as it involves a single peek operation on `q1`.
  - `empty`: $$O(1)$$, as it involves checking if `q1` is empty.

- **Space complexity**: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the number of elements stored in the stack, due to the use of two queues.

# Code
```java
class MyStack {
    Queue<Integer> q1;
    Queue<Integer> q2;

    public MyStack() {
        q1 = new LinkedList<>();
        q2 = new LinkedList<>();
    }
    
    public void push(int x) {
        // Move all elements from q1 to q2
        while (!q1.isEmpty()) {
            q2.add(q1.remove());
        }

        // Add the new element to q1
        q1.add(x);

        // Move all elements back from q2 to q1
        while (!q2.isEmpty()) {
            q1.add(q2.remove());
        }
    }
    
    public int pop() {
        return q1.remove();
    }
    
    public int top() {
        return q1.peek();
    }
    
    public boolean empty() {
        return q1.isEmpty();
    }
}

/**
 * Your MyStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyStack obj = new MyStack();
 * obj.push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
