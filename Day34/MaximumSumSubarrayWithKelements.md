### Intuition
The goal is to find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k` in the given array list `Arr`.

### Approach
1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the current window of elements.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Maintain a variable `sum` to keep track of the current sum of elements in the window.
3. **Adjust Window Size**: Slide the window by adjusting `start` and `end` based on the size of the window (`k`).
4. **Update Maximum Sum**: Update `max` whenever the size of the window reaches `k` and compute the maximum of the current sum and `max`.
5. **Optimization**: Avoid recalculating the sum from scratch for each window by adjusting `sum` based on the movement of `start` and `end`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in **O(N)** time, where `N` is the number of elements in `Arr`. This is because each element is processed at most twice (once when added and once when removed from the sum).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Code
```java
//User function Template for Java
class Solution{
    static long maximumSumSubarray(int k, ArrayList<Integer> Arr, int N) {
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        long sum = 0;
        long max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        while (end < N) {
            sum += Arr.get(end);
            
            if (end - start + 1 < k) {
                end++;
            } else if (end - start + 1 == k) {
                max = Math.max(max, sum);
                sum -= Arr.get(start);
                start++;
                end++;
            }
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```
