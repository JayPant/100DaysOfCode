# Intuition
The goal is to find the minimum number of white blocks (`'W'`) that need to be recolored to achieve at least \( k \) consecutive black blocks (`'B'`). This problem can be efficiently solved using a sliding window approach, where we maintain a window of size \( k \) and track the number of white blocks within this window.

# Approach
1. **Initial Count**: Calculate the number of white blocks within the first window of size \( k \).
2. **Sliding Window**: Slide the window one position at a time from the start of the string to the end.
   - For each new block that enters the window, adjust the count of white blocks.
   - For each block that leaves the window, adjust the count of white blocks.
3. **Track Minimum**: Keep track of the minimum number of white blocks encountered in any window of size \( k \).
4. **Result**: The minimum number of white blocks encountered will be the answer, as these need to be recolored to achieve the desired number of consecutive black blocks.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string `blocks`. We make a single pass through the string.
- Space complexity: \( O(1) \), as we use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumRecolors(String blocks, int k) {
        int n = blocks.length();
        int minRecolors = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // Count the number of 'W's in the first window of size k
        int currentWhites = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (blocks.charAt(i) == 'W') {
                currentWhites++;
            }
        }
        
        // Initialize the minimum recolors with the initial count
        minRecolors = currentWhites;
        
        // Slide the window from the beginning to the end of the string
        for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            // Remove the leftmost element of the previous window
            if (blocks.charAt(i - k) == 'W') {
                currentWhites--;
            }
            // Add the new element of the current window
            if (blocks.charAt(i) == 'W') {
                currentWhites++;
            }
            // Update the minimum recolors
            minRecolors = Math.min(minRecolors, currentWhites);
        }
        
        return minRecolors;
    }
}
```
