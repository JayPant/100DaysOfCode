# Intuition
The problem requires rearranging the array such that positive and negative numbers alternate. To achieve this, we can use separate indices to place positive and negative numbers at their respective positions.

# Approach
Initialize the Result Array: Create an array ans of the same length as the input array to store the rearranged elements.
Separate Indices for Positive and Negative: Use two indices, posIdx starting at 0 and incremented by 2 for positive numbers, and negIdx starting at 1 and incremented by 2 for negative numbers.
Iterate and Place: Traverse through the input array, placing positive numbers at posIdx and negative numbers at negIdx, and increment the respective indices accordingly.

# Complexity
Time complexity:
The time complexity is (O(n)) because we iterate through the array once.

Space complexity:
The space complexity is (O(n)) because we use an additional array ans of the same length as the input array.

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];

        int posIdx = 0, negIdx = 1;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0) {
                ans[posIdx] = num;
                posIdx += 2;
            } else {
                ans[negIdx] = num;
                negIdx += 2;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

# Explanation:
Initialization: ans array is initialized to store the rearranged elements.
Positive and Negative Indices: posIdx starts at 0 and negIdx starts at 1 to ensure alternation.
Placement Loop: Iterate through each number in nums. Place positive numbers at even indices and negative numbers at odd indices, then increment the respective index by 2.
Return: The rearranged array is returned.
