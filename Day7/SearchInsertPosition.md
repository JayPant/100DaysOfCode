# Intuition
When tasked with finding the index at which a target element should be inserted into a sorted array, my first thought was to use the binary search algorithm. Binary search is efficient for sorted arrays and can quickly narrow down the potential insert position by repeatedly halving the search range.

# Approach
To solve this problem, I implemented the binary search algorithm with the following steps:

Initialize two pointers, low and high, to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
While the low pointer is less than or equal to the high pointer:
Calculate the middle index mid.
If the element at mid is the target, return mid because the target is already in the array.
If the element at mid is less than the target, move the low pointer to mid + 1 because the target must be in the right half.
If the element at mid is greater than the target, move the high pointer to mid - 1 because the target must be in the left half.
If the loop ends without finding the target, low will be the index at which the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
This approach ensures that we efficiently find the correct insert position or the exact match using binary search.

# Complexity
Time complexity: O(log‚Å°n), where (n) is the number of elements in the array, because the search range is halved with each iteration.
Space complexity: O(1), as no extra space is used except for a few variables.


# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }
}
