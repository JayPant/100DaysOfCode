## Intuition
The problem requires finding a 132 pattern in a given array of integers, where `a[i] < a[k] < a[j]` and `i < j < k`. The first thought is to find three numbers in the array such that they follow this pattern. The challenge is to do this efficiently.

## Approach
1. **Use a Stack to Track Potential "3" Values**:
   - We maintain a stack to keep track of potential "3" values (`a[j]`) in the 132 pattern.
   - We iterate through the array from the end to the beginning. This reverse iteration helps us efficiently find the "2" value (`a[k]`) for any "3" value tracked in the stack.

2. **Maintain a Variable for the Maximum "2" Value**:
   - We keep a variable `second` to store the maximum value of "2" (`a[k]`) found so far while iterating. This helps us determine if a "1" value (`a[i]`) can exist for the current "2" and "3" values.

3. **Update the Stack and `second`**:
   - For each element in the array, if it's less than `second`, we've found a valid 132 pattern and return `true`.
   - If it's greater than the top of the stack, we keep popping from the stack and updating `second` until the stack is empty or the top of the stack is greater than the current element. This ensures that `second` always represents the largest possible "2" value.
   - Push the current element onto the stack as a potential "3" value.

4. **Return False if No Pattern is Found**:
   - If we finish iterating through the array without finding the pattern, return `false`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, resulting in a linear time complexity.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - The stack can contain at most `n` elements, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean find132pattern(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 3) return false;

        Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();
        int second = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (nums[i] < second) {
                return true;
            } else {
                while (!s.isEmpty() && nums[i] > s.peek()) {
                    second = s.pop();
                }
            }

            s.push(nums[i]);
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
