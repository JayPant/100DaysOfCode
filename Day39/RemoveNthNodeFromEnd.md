## Intuition
To remove the Nth node from the end of a singly linked list, the straightforward way is to first determine the length of the list. Once we have the length, we can easily identify the node that needs to be removed by calculating its position from the start of the list. 

## Approach 
1. **Calculate the Length of the List**: Traverse the list to find its total length.
2. **Identify the Node to Remove**: Calculate the position of the Nth node from the start using the formula `length - n`.
3. **Remove the Node**: Traverse the list again to reach the node just before the target node and update its `next` pointer to skip the target node.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Initialize a variable `size` to 0 and a pointer `temp` to the head of the list.
2. Traverse the list with `temp` to calculate the total number of nodes (`size`).
3. If `n` is equal to `size`, it means we need to remove the head of the list. Update the head to `head.next` and return.
4. Calculate the position of the node just before the target node using `size - n`.
5. Traverse the list again with a pointer `prev` to reach this node.
6. Update the `next` pointer of this node to skip the Nth node.
7. Return the head of the modified list.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: \(O(L)\), where \(L\) is the length of the linked list. We traverse the list twice, once to calculate the length and once to find the node to remove.
- **Space complexity**: \(O(1)\). We use only a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {        
        int size = 0;
        ListNode temp = head;
        
        // Calculate the size of the list
        while (temp != null) {
            temp = temp.next;
            size++;
        }
        
        // If we need to remove the head
        if (n == size) {
            head = head.next;
            return head;
        }
        
        // Calculate the position of the node just before the target node
        int nthNode = size - n;
        int nth = 1;
        ListNode prev = head;
        
        // Traverse to the node just before the target node
        while (nth < nthNode) {
            prev = prev.next;
            nth++;
        }
        
        // Remove the target node
        prev.next = prev.next.next;
        return head;
    }
}
```
