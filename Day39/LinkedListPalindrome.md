## Intuition
To determine if a singly linked list is a palindrome, we can leverage the fact that a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that the first half of the list should match the reversed second half. Therefore, we can solve this problem by finding the midpoint of the list, reversing the second half, and then comparing the two halves.

## Approach
1. **Find the Middle of the List**: Use the two-pointer technique (slow and fast pointers) to find the middle node of the list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the midpoint.
2. **Reverse the Second Half**: Reverse the second half of the list starting from the middle node.
3. **Compare the Two Halves**: Compare the first half of the list with the reversed second half node by node. If all corresponding nodes are equal, the list is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list to find the midpoint, reverse the second half, and then compare the two halves.
- **Space complexity**: \(O(1)\). We use a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    // Helper function to find the middle of the list
    public ListNode findMid(ListNode head){
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        return slow;
    }

    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return true;
        }

        // Step 1: Find the middle of the list
        ListNode midNode = findMid(head);

        // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = midNode;
        ListNode next;
        
        while (curr != null) {
            next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }

        // Step 3: Compare the first and second halves
        ListNode right = prev; // Start of the reversed second half
        ListNode left = head; // Start of the first half

        while (right != null) {
            if (left.val != right.val) {
                return false;
            }
            left = left.next;
            right = right.next;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
