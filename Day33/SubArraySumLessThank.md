### Intuition
The idea is to use a sliding window to maintain a product of elements within the current window. By adjusting the window size and updating the product, we can efficiently count the valid subarrays without having to compute the product for every possible subarray.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**: Start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, both set to the beginning of the array. Also, initialize a variable `prod` to keep track of the product of elements in the current window, and a counter `count` to store the number of valid subarrays.
2. **Expand the Window**: Move the `right` pointer to expand the window. For each new element added to the window, multiply it to the `prod`.
3. **Shrink the Window**: If the product becomes equal to or exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right until the product is less than `k` again. During this process, divide the product by the element at the `left` pointer.
4. **Count Valid Subarrays**: For each position of `right`, the number of valid subarrays ending at `right` is `(right - left + 1)`, because each subarray starting from any index between `left` and `right` (inclusive) and ending at `right` is valid.
5. **Return the Count**: After processing all elements, return the total count of valid subarrays.

### Complexity
- **Time complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice, once when expanding the window and once when shrinking it.
- **Space complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using only a few extra variables.

### Code
Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (k <= 1) return 0; // If k is 0 or 1, no products can be less than k
        
        int prod = 1;
        int count = 0;
        int left = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            prod *= nums[right];
            
            while (prod >= k && left <= right) {
                prod /= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            
            count += right - left + 1;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
